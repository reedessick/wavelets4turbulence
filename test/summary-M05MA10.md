# Analysis of `M05MA10 Turb_hdf5_plt_cnt_0050`

**TO DO**

  * inspect the behavior of dens, mag, vel by eye for anything interesting
    - for vectors, look both at
      * magnitude
      * cartesian components
    - also compute the following for vectors (and treat them as additional vectors)
      * curl? <-- look for evidence of vorticity?
      * div?
  * update xlim selection to better highlight distributions that are not centered on zero
  * look at "normal" spectrograms (k vs x) for 1D lines through the grid
    - consider ever possible line? (expensive...)
    - just pick one as representative?
  * look at other wavelet transforms (maybe Haar is obscuring something?)
